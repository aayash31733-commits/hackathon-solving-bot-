## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Good Problem Statements
✅ **Do:**
- Be specific about the problem you're solving
- Mention target users or audience
- List key features or requirements
- Include any technical constraints
- Specify the platform (web, mobile, desktop)

❌ **Don't:**
- Be too vague ("Make an app")
- Skip important details
- Use overly technical jargon without context

### Example Problem Statement
```
Create a mobile app that helps college students find study groups 
based on their courses, location, and study preferences. The app 
should include:
- User profiles with course schedules
- Location-based group discovery
- Real-time chat functionality
- Study session scheduling
- Gamification to encourage participation
- Push notifications for group updates

Target users: College students aged 18-25
Platform: iOS and Android
Timeline: 24-hour hackathon
```
